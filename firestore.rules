/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for QuickNote application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has exclusive access to their own notes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All notes are nested under `/users/{userId}/notes/{noteId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Users can only access their own notes.
 *  - User listing is implicitly denied as there is no top-level `users` collection.
 *  - The rules explicitly deny any ambiguous or potentially insecure access patterns.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules leverage the path-based ownership to avoid any `get()` calls for authorization. The `userId` from the path is used directly to verify ownership.

     * @allow (delete) - User 'user_abc' can delete note /users/user_abc/notes/note_xyz.
     * @deny (create) - User 'user_def' cannot create a note under /users/user_abc/notes/note_xyz.
     * @deny (get) - User 'user_def' cannot read note /users/user_abc/notes/note_xyz.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for writes.
